# Customer-Segmentation-analysis

In this small project, I have leveraged K-means clustering algorithm to dissect and understand customer behavior. By organizing customers into distinct groups based on similarities in their purchasing habits, spending patterns, and income level, valuable insights are drawn that drive strategic decision-making. With a focus on optimizing marketing strategies, product offerings, and customer experiences, this project showcases the transformative potential of data-driven segmentation techniques. With this project, our aim is to empower businesses to enhance customer satisfaction, maximize engagement, and ultimately drive growth.

Customer segmentation analysis using K-means clustering is a technique for dividing customers into distinct groups based on similar characteristics or behaviors. In this method, the algorithm iteratively assigns each customer to the nearest centroid, Â creating clusters that maximize intra-cluster similarity and minimize inter-cluster similarity. By identifying different groups of customers, businesses can tailor marketing strategies, product offerings, and customer experiences to better meet the needs and preferences of each segment. K-means clustering enables companies to gain insights into customer behavior, optimize resource allocation, and ultimately improve customer satisfaction and loyalty
